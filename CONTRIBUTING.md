# Contributing

Agama is an open source project and as such it welcomes all kinds of
contributions. But this is a special helper repository not intended for direct
contributions.

## Translations

For adding or updating the translations it is recommended to use the [Weblate](
https://l10n.opensuse.org/projects/agama/) online tool. Weblate provides a nice
web interface and the changes are automatically saved to this repository.

## Bugs

If you find a bug in original untranslated text then please [open an issue](
https://github.com/openSUSE/agama/issues/new) in the main Agama GitHub
repository.

*Thank you in advance for your help!*
